# DC_Data_analysis
This project is about the visualization of 2018 requests data in washington DC about the various typrs of complaints made by the residents of DC.
Instructions for running the code are all encoded in the Juyter notebook which is self-sustainable, you might want to install all the libraries used in your Anaconda evironment before running the code though.
Also, this project has been carried out as a part of the data visualization project in our Data Science course.
